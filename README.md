# Javascript Documents

JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

***Prerequisites***

basic knowledge in javascript :
Just be comfortable with the general programming paradigms!
Understand variables and their datatypes.
Get familiar with object oriented as well as procedure oriented programming.

```javascript
// Run

sudo apt update

```
Install the OpenJDK 8 package by typing:

```javascript
// Run

sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk

```
Verify the installation by typing the following command which will print the Java version:

```javascript
// Run

java -version

```

The output should look something like this:

```javascript
// The output

openjdk version "1.8.0_191"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_191-8u191-b12-2ubuntu0.18.04.1-b12)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.191-b12, mixed mode)

```
***Installing Android Studio***

At the time of writing this article, the latest stable version of Android Studio is version 3.3.1.0. The easiest way is to install Android Studio on Ubuntu 18.04 is by using the snappy packaging system.

To download and install the Android Studio snap package, open your terminal using the Ctrl+Alt+T keyboard shortcut and type:

```javascript
// run

sudo snap install android-studio --classic

```
Once the installation is complete, you will see the following output:

```javascript
// The output

android-studio 3.3.1.0 from Snapcrafters installed
```
That’s it. Android Studio has been installed on your Ubuntu desktop.

***Arduino IDE***

The Arduino Integrated Development Environment is a cross-platform application that is written in functions from C and C++. It is used to write and upload programs to Arduino compatible boards, but also, with the help of 3rd party cores, other vendor development boards.

***Which language is used in Arduino IDE?***

The "Arduino language" is simply C++ (and therefore also C). All the standard system librarys are written in C/C++ and the IDE uses the gcc g++ compiler.

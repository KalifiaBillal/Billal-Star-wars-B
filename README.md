*** How to Install Visual Studio Code on Ubuntu ***

Visual Studio Code is a powerful open-source code editor developed by Microsoft. It has built-in debugging support, embedded Git control, syntax highlighting, code completion, integrated terminal, code refactoring, and snippets.

Visual Studio Code Core is cross-platform, available on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

This guide shows two ways of installing Visual Studio Code on Ubuntu 20.04. VS Code can be installed as a snap package via the Snapcraft store or as a deb package from Microsoft repositories.

Update the packages index and install the dependencies by running the following command as a user with sudo privileges:

```javascript
// run

sudo apt update
sudo apt install software-properties-common apt-transport-https wget

```
Import the Microsoft GPG key using the following wget command:

```javascript
// The output

wget -q https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc -O- | sudo apt-key add -
```

And enable the Visual Studio Code repository by typing:

```javascript
// The output

sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/vscode stable main"

```
Once the apt repository is enabled, install the Visual Studio Code package:

```javascript
// The output

sudo apt install code

```

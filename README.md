# Javascript Documents

JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

***Prerequisites***

basic knowledge in javascript :
Just be comfortable with the general programming paradigms!
Understand variables and their datatypes.
Get familiar with object oriented as well as procedure oriented programming.

```Git the project
// Run

git clone https://github.com/KalifiaBillal/Simple-JavaScript-game
```
Install the OpenJDK 8 package by typing:

```Move into the file 
// Run

cd Simple-JavaScript-game

```
Verify the installation by typing the following command which will print the Java version:

```The project Tree
// Run 
tree -d

```

The output should look something like this:

```javascript
// The output

├── css
├── img
│   ├── meteorites
│   ├── plane
│   └── star
├── js
│   ├── class
│   ├── config
│   ├── scenes
│   └── utils
└── sound

11 directories

```

***Arduino IDE***

The Arduino Integrated Development Environment is a cross-platform application that is written in functions from C and C++. It is used to write and upload programs to Arduino compatible boards, but also, with the help of 3rd party cores, other vendor development boards.

***Which language is used in Arduino IDE?***

The "Arduino language" is simply C++ (and therefore also C). All the standard system librarys are written in C/C++ and the IDE uses the gcc g++ compiler.
